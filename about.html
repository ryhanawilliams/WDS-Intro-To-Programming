            <h2>About Moonlight Coffee Co.</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2020, Moonlight Coffee Co. began as a small dream to bring exceptional coffee to our community. What started as a passion project has grown into a beloved local coffeehouse where friends gather, ideas flow, and memories are made.</p>
            <p>We believe that great coffee starts with great beans. That's why we work directly with sustainable farms around the world to source only the finest coffee beans. Our master roasters carefully craft each batch to perfection, bringing out unique flavors and aromas in every cup.</p>
            <p>But coffee is more than just a beverage to us—it's a way to bring people together. Whether you're starting your day with an espresso, meeting a friend for a latte, or studying late into the night, we're here to make your experience special.</p>
